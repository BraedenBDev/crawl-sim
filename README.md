# crawl-sim

**Your site ranks #1 on Google but doesn't exist in ChatGPT search results. Here's why.**

The web now has two audiences: browsers and bots. Google renders your JavaScript and sees everything. GPTBot, ClaudeBot, and PerplexityBot don't — they read your server HTML and move on. If your content lives behind client-side hydration, AI search engines cite your competitors instead of you. Meanwhile, Cloudflare has been blocking AI training crawlers by default on 20% of the web since July 2025, and ChatGPT-User and Perplexity-User ignore robots.txt entirely for user-initiated fetches — so your carefully crafted blocking rules may not be doing what you think. The gap between what Google sees and what AI sees is the new SEO blind spot, and most tools don't even know it exists.

`crawl-sim` was built from a real bug: an `ssr: false` flag on a dynamic import was silently hiding article cards from every AI crawler on a production site. Screaming Frog didn't catch it — it's built around Googlebot's headless Chrome. The fix took two minutes once we could see the problem. The problem took weeks to find because nothing was looking.

This is for web developers checking their own sites, agencies auditing clients who need quantified proof of the visibility gap, and SEO teams adding GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) to their toolkit. Before crawl-sim, you'd curl as GPTBot and eyeball the HTML. Now you get a scored, regression-tested audit across nine bot profiles that tells you exactly what each crawler sees, what it misses, whether your robots.txt blocks actually work, and what to fix first.

It ships as a [Claude Code plugin](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) backed by standalone shell scripts — the intelligence lives in the agent, the plumbing stays debuggable.

---

## Why a plugin instead of prompting Claude directly?

Claude Code has Bash, curl, and jq. It *could* write all of this from scratch every time you ask. But that's the wrong comparison. Here's what actually happens:

| | Without crawl-sim | With crawl-sim |
|---|---|---|
| **User prompt** | ~500 tokens explaining what you want | `/crawl-sim https://site.com` — 20 tokens |
| **Bot UA strings** | Claude guesses or hallucinates them | 9 verified profiles with researched data |
| **Scoring logic** | Claude invents it mid-conversation (~3,000 tokens) | `compute-score.sh` runs in bash — 0 tokens |
| **Edge case handling** | Claude debugs live (~2,000 tokens) | 70 regression tests already caught those bugs |
| **robots.txt analysis** | Generic "blocked/not blocked" | Enforceability context — is the block actually enforceable? |
| **Total output tokens** | ~10,000+ per audit | ~2,500 per audit |

The scripts do the heavy lifting in bash, not in your context window. Scoring, extraction, field validation, parity computation — all zero tokens. Claude only spends tokens on interpretation.

**What this means in practice:**
- **Consistent.** Same rubric every run, not dependent on how Claude feels today. Page-type-aware schema scoring, cross-bot parity, critical-fail criteria — all tested.
- **Accurate.** Bot profiles include Cloudflare tier classification, robots.txt enforceability, and documented bypass behavior. You'd have to research this yourself otherwise.
- **Fast.** One command replaces 30 minutes of ad-hoc scripting and guesswork.
- **Debuggable.** Every script is standalone, outputs JSON, and can be run independently. When something looks wrong, you inspect the intermediate files — not a wall of LLM output.

## Quick start

### As a Claude Code plugin (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add BraedenBDev/crawl-sim
/plugin install crawl-sim@crawl-sim
```

Then invoke:

```
/crawl-sim https://yoursite.com
```

Claude runs the full pipeline, interprets the results, and returns a score card plus prioritized findings.

> **Verified:** Plugin installs from GitHub via the marketplace route, discovers the skill at `skills/crawl-sim/SKILL.md`, and all 15 scripts + 9 profiles are executable from the plugin cache path.

### Via npm (alternative)

```bash
npm install -g @braedenbuilds/crawl-sim
crawl-sim install              # → ~/.claude/skills/crawl-sim/
crawl-sim install --project    # → .claude/skills/crawl-sim/
```

### As a standalone CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BraedenBDev/crawl-sim.git
cd crawl-sim
./scripts/fetch-as-bot.sh https://yoursite.com profiles/gptbot.json | jq .
```

### Prerequisites

- **`curl`** — pre-installed on macOS/Linux
- **`jq`** — `brew install jq` (macOS) or `apt install jq` (Linux)
- **`playwright`** (optional) — for Googlebot JS-render comparison: `npx playwright install chromium`
- **Chrome or Playwright** (optional) — for PDF report generation

---

## Features

- **Multi-bot simulation.** Nine verified bot profiles covering Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity — including the bot-vs-user-agent distinction (e.g., `ChatGPT-User` officially ignores robots.txt; `claude-user` respects it).
- **Quantified scoring.** Each bot is graded 0–100 across five categories with letter grades A through F, plus a weighted composite score.
- **Page-type-aware rubric.** The structured-data category derives the page type from the URL (`root` / `detail` / `archive` / `faq` / `about` / `contact` / `generic`) and applies a per-type schema rubric. A homepage shipping `Organization` + `WebSite` scores 100 without being penalized for missing `BreadcrumbList` or `FAQPage`. Override the detection with `--page-type <type>` when the URL heuristic picks wrong.
- **Self-explaining scores.** Every `structuredData` block ships `pageType`, `expected`, `present`, `missing`, `violations` (with `confidence` levels), `calculation`, and `notes` — so the narrative reads the scorer's reasoning directly instead of guessing.
- **Schema field validation.** Checks that present schemas include required fields per schema.org type (e.g., Organization must have `name` + `url`). Missing required fields produce `missing_required_field` violations.
- **Cross-bot parity scoring.** Measures word-count divergence across bots. Perfect parity = 100/A. Severe CSR mismatch (Googlebot sees 10x more than GPTBot) = F with interpretation.
- **robots.txt enforceability.** Each bot profile carries `robotsTxtEnforceability` (`enforced`, `advisory_only`, `stealth_risk`) based on documented compliance. When robots.txt blocks a bot that ignores it, the narrative flags the block as unenforceable.
- **Cloudflare-aware.** Bot profiles include `cloudflareCategory` (`ai_crawler`, `ai_search`, `ai_assistant`) matching Cloudflare's three-tier classification. Since July 2025, Cloudflare blocks AI training crawlers by default on ~20% of the web.
- **PDF reports.** Generate styled HTML audit reports and convert to PDF via Chrome or Playwright. Pass `--pdf` for a one-command PDF to Desktop.
- **Comparative audits.** `--compare <url2>` runs two full audits and produces a side-by-side VS report with category deltas, per-bot comparison, and winner determination. Combine with `--pdf` for a comparison PDF.
- **Consolidated report.** `build-report.sh` merges score data with raw per-bot extraction data into a single `crawl-sim-report.json`. The narrative reads one file instead of 8+.
- **Agent-native interpretation.** The Claude Code skill reads raw data, identifies root causes (framework signals, hydration boundaries, soft-404s), and recommends specific fixes.
- **Three-layer output.** Terminal score card, prose narrative, and structured JSON — so humans and CI both get what they need.
- **Shell-native core.** All checks use only `curl` + `jq`. No Node, no Python, no Docker. Each script is independently invokable.
- **Regression-tested.** `npm test` runs a 70-assertion scoring suite against synthetic fixtures, covering URL→page-type detection, per-type rubrics, field validation, parity scoring, critical-fail criteria, and golden non-structured output.
- **Extensible.** Drop a new profile JSON into `profiles/` and it's auto-discovered.

## Usage

### Claude Code skill

```
/crawl-sim https://yoursite.com                                    # full audit
/crawl-sim https://yoursite.com --bot gptbot                       # single bot
/crawl-sim https://yoursite.com --category structured-data         # category deep-dive
/crawl-sim https://yoursite.com --json                             # JSON only (for CI)
/crawl-sim https://yoursite.com --pdf                              # audit + PDF report
/crawl-sim https://yoursite.com --compare https://competitor.com   # side-by-side comparison
/crawl-sim https://yoursite.com --compare https://competitor.com --pdf  # comparison PDF
```

The skill auto-detects page type from the URL. Pass `--page-type root|detail|archive|faq|about|contact|generic` when the URL heuristic picks the wrong type (e.g., a homepage at `/en/` that parses as `generic`).

Output is a three-layer report:

1. **Score card** — ASCII overview with per-bot and per-category scores. When content parity is high (all bots see the same content), bot rows collapse to a single line.
2. **Narrative audit** — prose findings ranked by point impact, with fix recommendations. Includes robots.txt enforceability context for each bot.
3. **JSON report** — saved to `crawl-sim-report.json` with score data + raw per-bot extraction data for diffing and automation.

### Direct script invocation

Every script is standalone and outputs JSON to stdout:

```bash
./scripts/fetch-as-bot.sh    https://yoursite.com profiles/gptbot.json
./scripts/extract-meta.sh    < response.html
./scripts/extract-jsonld.sh  < response.html
./scripts/extract-links.sh   https://yoursite.com < response.html
./scripts/check-robots.sh    https://yoursite.com GPTBot
./scripts/check-llmstxt.sh   https://yoursite.com
./scripts/check-sitemap.sh   https://yoursite.com
./scripts/compute-score.sh   /tmp/audit-data/
./scripts/build-report.sh    /tmp/audit-data/               # consolidated report
./scripts/generate-report-html.sh crawl-sim-report.json      # HTML report
./scripts/html-to-pdf.sh     report.html output.pdf          # PDF conversion
```

### CI/CD

```yaml
- name: crawl-sim audit
  run: |
    ./scripts/fetch-as-bot.sh "$DEPLOY_URL" profiles/gptbot.json > /tmp/gptbot.json
    ./scripts/compute-score.sh /tmp/ > /tmp/score.json
    jq -e '.overall.score >= 70' /tmp/score.json
```

## Scoring system

Each bot is scored 0–100 across five weighted categories:

| Category | Weight | Measures |
|----------|:------:|----------|
| **Accessibility** | 25 | robots.txt allows, HTTP 200, response time. Robots blocking = auto-F (critical-fail). |
| **Content Visibility** | 30 | server HTML word count, heading structure, internal links, image alt text |
| **Structured Data** | 20 | JSON-LD presence, validity, per-type `@type` rubric, required field validation |
| **Technical Signals** | 15 | title / description / canonical / OG meta, sitemap inclusion |
| **AI Readiness** | 10 | `llms.txt` and/or `llms-full.txt` structure, content citability |

**Overall composite** weighs bots by reach:

- Googlebot **40%** — still the primary search driver
- GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot — **20% each** — the AI visibility tier

**Cross-bot parity** is scored separately (not part of the composite). It measures whether all bots see the same content. A severe CSR mismatch (Googlebot renders JS and sees 10x more content than AI bots) surfaces as the headline finding.

**Grade thresholds**

| Score | Grade | Meaning |
|-------|:-----:|---------|
| 93–100 | A | Fully visible, well-structured, citable |
| 90–92 | A- | Near-perfect with minor gaps |
| 80–89 | B / B+ / B- | Visible but missing optimization opportunities |
| 70–79 | C+ / C / C- | Partially visible, significant gaps |
| 60–69 | D+ / D / D- | Major issues — limited discoverability |
| 0–59 | F | Invisible or broken for this bot |

## Supported bots

| Profile | Vendor | Purpose | JS Render | robots.txt | Enforceability | Cloudflare tier |
|---------|--------|---------|:---------:|:----------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|
| `googlebot` | Google | Search | **yes** | yes | enforced | search_engine |
| `gptbot` | OpenAI | Training | no | yes | enforced | ai_crawler |
| `oai-searchbot` | OpenAI | Search | unknown | yes | enforced | ai_search |
| `chatgpt-user` | OpenAI | User fetch | unknown | partial | **advisory_only** | ai_assistant |
| `claudebot` | Anthropic | Training | no | yes | enforced | ai_crawler |
| `claude-user` | Anthropic | User fetch | unknown | yes | enforced | ai_assistant |
| `claude-searchbot` | Anthropic | Search | unknown | yes | enforced | ai_search |
| `perplexitybot` | Perplexity | Search | no | yes | **stealth_risk** | ai_search |
| `perplexity-user` | Perplexity | User fetch | unknown | no | **advisory_only** | ai_assistant |

**Enforceability key:**
- **enforced** — the bot respects robots.txt directives
- **advisory_only** — the bot's vendor has stated user-initiated fetches may ignore robots.txt. Blocking via robots.txt alone has no effect; network-level enforcement (e.g., Cloudflare WAF) is needed.
- **stealth_risk** — the bot claims compliance, but Cloudflare has documented instances of undeclared crawlers with generic user-agent strings bypassing blocks.

**Cloudflare context:** Since July 2025, Cloudflare blocks all `ai_crawler` tier bots by default on new domains (~20% of the web). `ai_search` and `ai_assistant` bots are in Cloudflare's verified bots directory and are not blocked by the default toggle.

Every profile is backed by official vendor documentation where possible. See [`research/bot-profiles-verified.md`](./research/bot-profiles-verified.md) for sources and confidence levels.

### Adding a custom bot

Drop a JSON file in `profiles/`. The skill auto-discovers all `*.json` files.

```json
{
  "id": "mybot",
  "name": "MyBot",
  "vendor": "Example Corp",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 ... MyBot/1.0",
  "robotsTxtToken": "MyBot",
  "purpose": "search",
  "cloudflareCategory": "ai_search",
  "robotsTxtEnforceability": "enforced",
  "rendersJavaScript": false,
  "respectsRobotsTxt": true,
  "lastVerified": "2026-04-12"
}
```

The shell scripts are the plumbing. The Claude Code skill is the intelligence — it reads the raw JSON, understands framework context (Next.js, Nuxt, SPAs), identifies root causes, and writes actionable recommendations.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on:

- Reporting bugs and requesting features
- Adding or updating bot profiles when vendor docs change
- Writing new check scripts (must be `curl` + `jq` only, must output JSON)
- Running the integration test suite
- Coding standards and commit conventions

Quick principles:

- **Keep the core dependency-free** — `curl` + `jq` only. `diff-render.sh` and `html-to-pdf.sh` are the optional-dependency exceptions.
- **Every script outputs valid JSON to stdout** and is testable against a live URL.
- **Cite sources** when adding or updating bot profiles — every behavioral claim needs a vendor doc link or a reproducible observation.
